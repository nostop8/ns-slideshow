To support automatic updates of playlists, there are 2 options:

1. Do this check regularly with AJAX call to the remote service. 
It may be regular frequency or for instance when the playlist loop has completed.
This is NOT the best option because the API service will receive regular requests 
where 99% of those might not be needed simply because no data has been updated.

2. Use WebSockets. This is the best option because the API will notify the clients 
about the updates only when they are available. So there will be no pointless 
requests to API.
